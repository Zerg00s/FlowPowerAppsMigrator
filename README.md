# Flow & Power Apps Migrator

Have you ever tried moving canvas apps or cloud flows across Microsoft 365 tenants or sites? This is a common task when deploying apps and flows to production. Apps and flows must be exported, and imported, and SharePoint actions must be manually updated. These manual updates are error-prone and labor-intensive. **Flow & Power Apps Migrator** automatically converts exported flows and apps to be compatible with the target environment. 

Flow & Power Apps Migrator also helps you migrate **SharePoint lists** that are used as a dependency for your Apps and Flows. There is an interactive UI form that lets you do just that.

Finally, the Flow & Power Apps Migrator converts **SharePoint List Forms customized with Power Apps**. 

## About this Fork

I updated Denis Molodtsov's Apps Migrator to use the latest version of the [PnP.PowerShell](https://github.com/pnp/powershell) which relies on PowerShell 7. As the API changed in this version I had to make a few minor changes in the code to adopt accordingly. 

This version of the Flow & Power Apps Migrator works also on tenants that prevent legacy authentication methods.

# Convert flows, apps and solutions

## Export flows, apps and solutions
Export all of your flows:

![](MISC/IMG/Export.png)

Export all of your apps:

![](MISC/IMG/ExportApp.png)

## 2. Place exported flows, apps and solutions in the src folder
![](MISC/IMG/2018-07-25-20-57-29.png)

## 3. Run Migrate-Packages.bat
The scripts will iterate through all ZIP files inside the `\src` directory and convert them to be compatible with the new Microsoft 365 tenant or site.
- Run `Migrate-Packages.bat` script

<img style="padding-left:50px" src="MISC/IMG/Migrator.png">

- Enter source site URL and target site URL:
- Keep `MIGRATE_LISTS` property set to `True` if you want to migrate SharePoint lists and libraries.

- Select lists and libraries to migrate

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2797648/138607789-1471e92e-c8d8-4813-8b1d-2f2deef962eb.png)


- Sit back and wait for the lists and libraries to be migrated and the conversion process to finish.


## 4. Navigate to the \dist folder and collect converted flows, apps and solutions

![](MISC/IMG/2018-07-25-21-11-04.png)

## 5. Import converted flows, apps and solutions
Now you can import your flows and apps to the destination tenant. All SharePoint actions will now be converted and point to the new location.


###  <b>Power Apps</b> data sources are all converted

![](MISC/IMG/DataSourcesConverted_2.0.png)

### <b>Flow actions</b> are also converted

![](MISC/IMG/FlowsConverted_2.0.png)

## How it works

**Flow & Power Apps Migrator** finds all unique IDs pointing to the source SharePoint site and replaces them with the destination IDs. `resourceMapping.csv` contains the mapping of these IDs.

![](MISC/IMG/CSV.png)

## Limitations

- Does not support macOS and Linux.
- Only SharePoint data sources are updated.
- ZIP packages might not be converted if placed in a long path name on disk. For this reason, try placing the migrator as close to the root drive as possible.

# Preparing a deployment package for your Clients and Partners

What if you created an app or flow you want your Client or Partner to have? You can package your SharePoint Lists and the apps and flows in a single package. Then you would like to hand over this package and simple installation instructions. Guess what? There is a script that prepares this package automatically for you.

`Prepare-Deployment-Package-for-Client.bat` script prepares a deployment package you can share with your Clients or Partners. 

## On your end

- Run `Prepare-Deployment-Package-for-Client.bat`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2797648/138600042-dc80f7ea-cc7a-4240-9c26-3dc2ed617e4b.png)

- Export your Solutions, Power Apps and Flows and save them to the `package\src` directory

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2797648/138600112-69dbe03d-3f66-4c4d-858a-d1473358280b.png)

- Send the `package` directory to your Client or Partner.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2797648/138608613-3ede0cf6-a331-4058-9feb-bf55030c7f55.png)


## On the Client's side

- If it does not already exists, create a SharePoint Online site. It will contain SharePoint Lists and Libraries that Power Apps/Flows require.
- Open the `package` directory.
- Run `Convert-Packages.bat` script. 
- Provide target site URL.
- Import all solutions, flows and apps from the `dist` directory.

**Note:** `Convert-Packages.bat` will:

- Deploy SharePoint lists and libraries (if you want to package them)
- Convert Apps and Flows from `src` and saves them to 'dist'.
